TODO: PROFILE SECTION :
//make code look better lol


DONE
added posts profile pics
add images to users page to
added alert when changed image and bio and real time change when user edits their profile
added functionality to change bio and change it to ui, make responsive
added images only to profile page
added backdrop and edit profile popup,
bio cant be longer than 100 letters
can only can edit bio and profile if user id == profile id

MAIN PROBLEM
//on profile tab, post id is different than mainfeed post id, so viewpost function cant find it RIP, data inconsistency
things i wish i couldve done better, consistent data, user.id and user.uid confusing, i was organized, put reusable functions in their own file.
//on inital load already check, if user refreshes their ui doesnt show they liked a post


not a full product. 
Bugs need to be fixed/Features needed


//Timestamp ago on mainfeed / not profile page
//Profile Images on replies tab on profile page 
//Like Count can be better
//adding post to the ui without having to refresh page = no real db data on the ui post as its temporary until users refreshes pages. (same with likes)

TODO: PROFILE SECTION :
            make edit profile btn function to edit bio n stuff

//ALERT BOX ON LOGIN ERROR and conform delete

/ON SIGN UP, fetch bad words dictionary n make sure its not on there???    
//favicon emoji
//make functions reusable

DONE
delete input after posting or replying
shows posts count of each user, can see replies of a user and who theyre replying to
//TIME AGO EACH POST
fix like -1 on click from 0 in viewpost, not mainfeed, and change color back to original when unliked

MAIN PROBLEM
//on profile tab, post id is different than mainfeed post id, so viewpost function cant find it RIP, data inconsistency
things i wish i couldve done better, consistent data, user.id and user.uid confusing, i was organized, put reusable functions in their own file.

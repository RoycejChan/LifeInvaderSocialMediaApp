TODO: PROFILE SECTION :
make edit profile btn function to edit bio n stuff
//fix timestamp and addingpost interferance
//post feed and posts count not chaning when clicking on usersbar


DONE
//site is responsive 
//add bottom nav
//make nav bar responsive
//posts no reply, make background same color ass post so its not black
// when lonely here too
//add responsiveness to error logs
and add post log 
//fix imagae responsiveness


MAIN PROBLEM
//on profile tab, post id is different than mainfeed post id, so viewpost function cant find it RIP, data inconsistency
things i wish i couldve done better, consistent data, user.id and user.uid confusing, i was organized, put reusable functions in their own file.
//on inital load already check, if user refreshes their ui doesnt show they liked a post



//padding distrupts bottom nav and main feed

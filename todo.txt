TODO: PROFILE SECTION :
make edit profile btn function to edit bio n stuff
//make functions reusable
//responsive
//fix timestamp and addingpost interferance
//add bottom nav bar to homepage.jsx as seperate component
//fix imagae responsiveness
//add msg, if user posts is empty, put msg 'its a bit lonely here'
if reply empty, give error
//add responsiveness to error logs
//add bottom nav

DONE
fixed viewPost text area css
and conform delete
added responsive ness to login page and homepage, profile page, and  view post page


MAIN PROBLEM
//on profile tab, post id is different than mainfeed post id, so viewpost function cant find it RIP, data inconsistency
things i wish i couldve done better, consistent data, user.id and user.uid confusing, i was organized, put reusable functions in their own file.
//on inital load already check, if user refreshes their ui doesnt show they liked a post

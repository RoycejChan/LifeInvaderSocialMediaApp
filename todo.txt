TODO: PROFILE SECTION :
make edit profile btn function to edit bio n stuff
//make functions reusable
and conform delete
//responsive
//fix timestamp and addingpost interferance

DONE
//favicon emoji
//check if username already exits then error
//display signup errors:user or email already taken, password shorter than 6 characters.

MAIN PROBLEM
//on profile tab, post id is different than mainfeed post id, so viewpost function cant find it RIP, data inconsistency
things i wish i couldve done better, consistent data, user.id and user.uid confusing, i was organized, put reusable functions in their own file.
//on inital load already check, if user refreshes their ui doesnt show they liked a post

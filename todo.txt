TODO: PROFILE SECTION :
make edit profile btn function to edit bio n stuff
//make functions reusable
//fix timestamp and addingpost interferance
//add bottom nav bar to homepage.jsx as seperate component
//fix imagae responsiveness
//add responsiveness to error logs
//add bottom nav



DONE
    post and reply no longer gives alert, button is initially disabled until user enters > 3 letters
    //add msg, if user posts is empty, put msg 'its a bit lonely here'
    //add back button to home when on post, and back button to post when clicked on profile from post



MAIN PROBLEM
//on profile tab, post id is different than mainfeed post id, so viewpost function cant find it RIP, data inconsistency
things i wish i couldve done better, consistent data, user.id and user.uid confusing, i was organized, put reusable functions in their own file.
//on inital load already check, if user refreshes their ui doesnt show they liked a post

//padding distrupts bottom nav and main feed
